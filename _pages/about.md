<p id=about> I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://neuralcoding.nl/">Neural Coding Lab</a>, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands where I work on neural coding with synthesized reality under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/guclu-u">Dr. Umut Güçlü</a>. My ultimate goal is to understand how the brain makes sense of the surrounding world to extract as well as insert information from and to the brain. As such, this knowledge could be incorporated in the development of clinical applications to help people with disabilities (e.g., neurostimulation to restore lost sensory functions or communication via non-muscular means) and non-clinical applications (e.g., reconstruction of subject-specific and common experiences).

My doctorate is funded by a personal toptalent fellowship and I have double master's degrees in artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience with cum laude. </p>
