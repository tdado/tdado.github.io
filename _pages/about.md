        Thirza Dado (1993) is a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.predictivebrainlab.com/">Predictive Brain Lab</a> of prof. Floris de Lange at the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/donders-institute">Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour</a> of the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en">Radboud University</a>, where she works on curiosity in biological and artificial systems. Curiosity is the intrinsic drive to seek information and engage with the unknown. Its reward lies in the intellectual satisfaction of knowing, a fulfillment that comes from within rather than from external incentives like money or praise. Previously, she completed her PhD on neural coding with synthesized reality, which was funded by a personal top-talent fellowship. Before that, she obtained double masterâ€™s degrees in artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience with cum laude.
