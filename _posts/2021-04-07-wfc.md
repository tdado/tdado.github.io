The synthesis algorithm <a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">wave function collapse</a> is loosely inspired on the concept from quantum mechanics; it uses a set of probabilities to describe all the possible states of a texture in superposition, which are then collapsed one-by-one to generate the resulting output pattern.

<i>Starting in superposition, each state collapse brings the image closer to a fully-collapsed pattern that looks locally similar to the input sample image (shown as the smaller image on the left).</i>
