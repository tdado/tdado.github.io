**Maya Shanti**:

*I’m hanging upside down*  
*And see the world is changing*  
*I don’t know what to think of now*  
*But it feels like I’m fading*  
*So many questions but I know it's always been there*  
*I know, does she know, does he know*  
*I know that I’m upfalling*  
*I know that I’m upfalling*  
*I know that I’m upfalling into this new world*  

**GPT-3**:  

*I close my eyes and dream*  
*Of a world that's brand new*  
*I hope that one day you'll see*   
*That changes can be good*  
*I can be good*  
*I can be good*
